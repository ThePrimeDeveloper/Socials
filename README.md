# 💻 Hacking: Database

## 📌 Overview
This Python script is a fun and interactive simulation of hacking into a database to retrieve [@ThePrimeDeveloper](https://github.com/ThePrimeDeveloper) social links. It uses ANSI escape codes to produce colorful terminal output and features a dynamic progress

---

## 🛠️ Features

- **Colored Output:** Utilizes ANSI escape codes for green, cyan, and yellow text.
- **Interactive Experience:** Prompts the user to press Enter to begin the hacking simulation.
- **Progress Bar Simulation:** Visually engaging progress bar that shows the hacking progress.
- **Reveals Social Links:** Displays top secret developer social links (GitHub, Discord, Telegram, Email) upon completion.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Print Title:**  
   The script prints a title banner in yellow to introduce the simulation.

2. **Print Introduction:**  
   A green introductory message is displayed, inviting the user to start the hacking process by pressing Enter.

3. **Progress Bar:**  
   A progress bar is displayed, incrementing from 0% to 100%, simulating the hacking process.

4. **Hack Database:**  
   The script simulates the initialization of hacking tools and confirms when the database hack is successful.

5. **Reveal Links:**  
   Finally, the developer's social links are revealed with brief delays between each, adding to the interactive experience.

## 💂️‍♂️ Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x:** Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
- **Terminal Support:** A terminal or command prompt that supports ANSI escape codes for colored output.

---

## 🚀 Running the Script

1. **Run the Script:**

   ```bash
   python socials.py
   ```

---

## 🔧 Customization

- **Social Links:** Modify the list of social links in the `reveal_links()` function as needed.
- **Progress Bar Timing:** Adjust the sleep duration in the `progress_bar()` function to change the speed of the simulation.
